     - BahÃ­a Blanca (industrial hub) and OlavarrÃ­a (cement industry) also exhibit significant emissions.  
     - Ramallo and Tordillo lead in per capita emissions, driven by low populations and high industrial outputs in comparison to their local community.
  
  3. **AMBA-Level Insights:**  
     - Buenos Aires City is the largest emitter in Argentina.  
     - Avellaneda contributes significantly through its petrochemical and tanning industries, as well as its large container terminal.  
     - Campana and ZÃ¡rate host key factories in steelmaking, automotive, and petrochemical industries.  
     - Ensenada leads in per capita emissions due to its industrial base and low population.
